## ![Importful](app/assets/images/logo.svg)

Hello! :wave:

You likely landed here because you applied to our [Ruby on Rails Developer position](#) and passed our technical interview. Congratulations for having made it so far!

## The challenge

As our customers bring their affiliate marketing campaigns to our systems, they love to send us CSV files of their existing data to be imported in our app.

Our research determined that this the feature that makes us really competitive in our market segment and that CSVs are the data format exchange of the future, so we decided to completely pivot our business to become the best affiliate data importer on the market and rebrand ourselves as **Importful** from now on.

As part of this effort, we would like to ask you to help us building our MVP and delight our customers with the best affiliate CSV importer on the market!

## Getting started

To save you time, this repository already contains the scaffold of a basic Rails project with some models, tests, and fixtures already set up.

To get started, create a new private repository, [using this as a template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template#creating-a-repository-from-a-template) and open a new feature branch on it.

### Setting up the app

1. Install the appropriate versions of Ruby and Node.js with your favorite tool version manager. You will also need to have `yarn` 1.x installed (`npm install -g yarn`).

2. Install the dependencies

   ```console
   bundle install
   yarn install
   ```

3. Prepare the database

   ```console
   bin/rails db:setup

   ```

4. Run the application
   ```console
   bin/dev
   ```

### Submitting the challenge

1. Open a pull request with your changes against your `main` branch (not this template repo!)

2. Invite @rewardful-recruiting to your repository as a read-only collaborator

3. Notify us via email that your code is ready for review
